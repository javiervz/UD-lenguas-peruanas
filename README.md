## Instructions for GitHub

1. If you have an issue about an annotation, please open an "Issue" (see tab), so other people can comment, and there is a record on how we solved any situation :)
2. Whenever you complete a task in the Project bar, please check the subtask related to your language. When all the subtasks are completed, we will close the related issue and move on.

## Wiki

Please use the [Wiki](https://github.com/javiervz/UD-lenguas-peruanas/wiki)! We can create new pages and document our progress there. Any info would be relevant! (criteria for filtering samples, discussion about tag sets, comparison betweeen languages, list of resources... ). The format to write a text is with Markdown, here there are some [quick instructions](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
